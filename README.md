# iChange
Coin Calculator

A delivery driver is looking for an easier way to determine how best to give a customer change when collecting payment. To do this, he has come to you to develop a simple iOS application that allows him to input the order total, and the amount of money the customer has given. The application should calculate how much change is required, and calculate how many of each coin ($0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1.00, $5.00, $10.00, $20.00, $50.00, $100.00) to give the customer, such that the minimum number of coins is required. 

For example; an order costs $8.91, the customer gives the driver $10.00. The application should return 4x$.01, 1x$.05, and 1x$1.00.
